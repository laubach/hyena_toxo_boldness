Univariate Analyses
 # histogram of SP ratio							--> done
 # univiariate table 								--> done


Bivariate Analyses
 # make table 2 - bivariate associations			--> done
 # make figures for bivariate analyses 				--> done
 	boxplots SP by age cat, sex human pop, 
 	rank etc.				

 # models to test (using both continuous sp 
	and categorical toxo diagnosis)
	
 Predictors of Toxo	
  # sp / toxo ~ sex	  								--> done
  # sp / toxo ~ age(cat)  							--> done
  # sp / toxo ~ human density 						--> done
  # sp / toxo ~ dominance							--> done
  # sp / toxo ~ julian date (categrocially)			--> not done
  # sp / toxo ~ reproductive status cycle			--> not done
  # sp / toxo ~ lifetime number of cubs				--> not done

 Toxo as a predictor  
  # longevity ~ sp 									--> done, but should do survival
  # proximity to lion ~ sp 							--> waiting for data
  # novel object neophobia ~ sp						--> waiting for data
  # hyena model neophobia ~ sp						--> waiting for data
  # microbiome ~ sp ... 							--> what microbiome data available
  


Adjusted Models

  # control continuous age
  # maybe control for park to avoid pseudo replication
  # continuous age as an offset
  # interaction models human pop x sex , human x age (cat)
  
  
other variables 
	hormones - testosterone 
		- sex specific effects
		- mediation analyses toxo -> hormones -> behavior
		
		loess plot x age , y toxo status, two lines one serena and one 
		
		leave out clan and social networks from now
